# Phoenix Deployment with Mix Releases

This is a simple Phoenix Hello World app that you can use as a starting point for your own Phoenix project on [Render](https://render.com).

This setup uses [Mix releases](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html) introduced in [Elixir 1.9](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-released/).

If you'd like to use [Distillery](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/), check out our guide to [Phoenix Deployment with Distillery](https://render.com/docs/deploy-phoenix-distillery).
